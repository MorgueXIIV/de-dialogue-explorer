<h3>Welcome to the FAYDE Playback Experiment!</h3>
</br>
Please follow these steps to install this program:
</br>
</br>
1) Visit <a href=https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>the Ruby webpage</a> and follow the relevant instructions for your operating system.
</br>
</br>
2) Open a command line and navigate to the directory in which you have these files. In Windows, press the Win key and type cmd, then press enter. Then you'll type something like 'cd C:\Users\yourname\Documents\de-dialogue-explorer'. Alternately if you don't want to type all that (i for one was too nervous when i first used the command line) you can use 'dir' to display the contents (including folders) of the current directory, 'cd foldername' to navigate to that folder, and 'cd ..' to move up a directory.
</br>
</br>
If you're not using Windows, for some reason I assume you already know how to do this. Just in case though, for Linux users you'll use Terminal and the navigation is almost the same except 'ls' rather than 'dir'. Mac users. . .don't use a Mac? (sorry, the real reason is that i don't actually know fuck all about how to use macs on more than a surface level)
</br>
</br>
3) Into your prompt, type 'gem install bundler' and press enter.
</br>
</br>
4) Type 'bundler install' and press enter.
</br>
</br>
5) Type 'ruby dealogueimport.db' and press enter. This will take a moment.
</br>
</br>
6) Finally, type 'ruby guidealoguebrowser.rb' and press enter. Then get a drink because this will /definitely/ take a moment.
</br>
</br>
</br>
How to navigate:
</br>
</br>
The interface is built to be fairly intuitive (i can say that, i'm not the mad genius who built it), and shouldn't present much difficulty. I'll try to explain it anyway but I'm exceptionally bad at explaining things, so good luck. 
</br>
</br>
If you have particular preferences about font or detail, skip to the 'configuration' tab for a moment and figure those out.
</br>
</br>
In the 'Search' tab, you can enter a search query and select how specific you would like it to be, as well as filter by the character/item/voice in Harry's head that said it. You can also skip the query entirely and get every line a certain actor said by typing in an actor and selecting 'Actor Dump'. ('Clear' is used to clear the actor field)
</br>
</br>
Once you've found your line of choice, you can select 'trace line', which allows you to go back and/or forward through the various parts of the conversation, or 'dump conversation', which will display every possible line of the conversation in the aptly named 'Dialogue Dump' tab.
</br>
</br>
I'm sure there's more (or will be by the time i'm done writing this because morgue codes like a demon on speed) but quite honestly I can't remember it right now, sorry. I'm sure I'll update this at some point. Probably.
</br>
</br>
Please blame any and all mistakes and/or terrible jokes in this readme on me (Zeiat), Morgue had nothing to do with this monstrosity. Enjoy <s>mainlining kim kitsuragi quotes</s> using the FAYDE Playback Experiment!
